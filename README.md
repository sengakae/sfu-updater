Updater 

The updater is a node.js script written in Javascript that performs all our info gathering. After a npm install , a user can pull relevant course data from SFU's course api using npm start and entering the desired year and term. Due to the reliability of SFU's api, several attempts may be required to successfully complete the pull. The db.js script will read a json file and write its data into the database specified in models/index.js (default pointed at a test db). detailing.js is a script that calls Google's ISBN api for further info gathering. It requires an input of a json file generated by start.js.
